# Orbital AI Driven Design

[orbitaladd.com](http://www.orbitaladd.pythonanywhere.com)

### Website development project in the python Django framework

## Purpose

Build a dynamic website that utilizes a MySQL database to serve up blog posts, 
manage admin access, and eventually a Django Rest API that lets users store 
and utilize Machine Learning models without the need to build and train the
models themselves.  

## Note
This is a developer learning project and as such will be open source as long 
as the website is hosted.  Anyone may copy and use the code as they see fit.  
If the developer wishes to monetize the API at a later date, that project 
will be built on a separate private repo.

## Summary of Tech Stack
The development build is hosted on [pythonanywhere](http://www.pythonanywhere.com).
The site was chosen because of its flexibility, great support for Django web apps, 
built in Jupyter Notebook app for python machine learning model training, and built
in database options including MySQL.  The web host also has built in bash, virtual 
environment, sql terminals which vastly increase the workflow when used.  The site
being dynamic means that the developer can keep site critical modules up to date in 
the virtual environment and for convenience the latest versions are listed in the
[requirements](requirements.txt) text file.

 ## Personal Shout Outs
 Initial drive and inspiration for the blog site goes to Mark Seaman's web development and
 software engineering classes at the University of Northern Colorado (UNCO).  The idea for developing
 an API for machine learning projects goes to Muhanad Manshad and his Object Oriented Systems
 Development class at UNCO.  It should be noted however this is a side/ personal project and not
 built in or for any class or grade.
